Reflections on last week Firday
----- Monday -----

What went well,

Thought that learning the basics of how test driven development is approached was useful to understand when makign a large programe.
Also that when you use test driven devlopment it is important that you make the test fail to ensure you have made the test correctly

What i could improve on,

As test driven development is still new i could work on creating more complicated tests
Also, again sometimes it was diffcult to see if it was the programme or the test that was wrong at times


Reflection on Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,

Learning the approach to test driven development in that it is important to break the programme in order to verfiy that your tests are correctly written
Also the approach to writing a programme when given only instructions and writing your own tests around that was good because it allowed me to code the programme how i wanted to

What i could imporve on,

The syntax for rspec, as i noticed there were many times where what i had in rspec was just a letter or 1 piece of punctuation away from it being right.


Reflection on Tuesday
----- Wednesday -----

What went well,

Completed the dice_app programme and enjoyed the idea of the scenarios being given and we have to mkae the test for them. 
Also learned more of rspec syntax and the structure i should follow in order to get a test working.

What i could improve on,

Focusing the tests to test specific things to do with the programme as i found myself writing the test and some parts of the test could have been more specifc to what the programme is acctually doing
