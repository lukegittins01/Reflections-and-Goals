Reflections on last week Firday

----- Monday -----

What went well,

Thought that learning the basics of how test driven development is approached was useful to understand when makign a large programe.
Also that when you use test driven devlopment it is important that you make the test fail to ensure you have made the test correctly

What i could improve on,
As test driven development is still new i could work on creating more complicated tests
Also, again sometimes it was diffcult to see if it was the programme or the test that was wrong at times
