Reflections on last friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I figured out stage 2 and 3 of the airport challnenge quicker than stage 1 but overall the progress for the airport challenge was good

what i could improve on,
- Don't overthink the task and take a step back if i am going down a wrong path
