Reflections on last friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I figured out stage 2 and 3 of the airport challnenge quicker than stage 1 but overall the progress for the airport challenge was good

what i could improve on,
- Don't overthink the task and take a step back if i am going down a wrong path


Reflection on Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I made a good start with pair programming and made effective use of the driver, navigator strategy with my pair.
- I think this made it much easier to spot errors and make progress much more swift in moving forward.

What i could improve on,
- I need to remember that for each test it is a completely seperate block of code to he other tests. As i find myself sometimes
  not writing important lines of code in the test that may be written in another test. For example for a plane to takeoff it must
  first be at the airport or have to land then take off. its the small important parts at the beginning that i need to make sure
  i include to avoid getting errors.


Reflection on Tuesday,
----- Wednesday -----

What went well,
- I enjoyed the domain model workshop in that i liked how we was told how to break down user stories based on nouns and verbs 
  to make classes and methods

What i could improve on,
- I think that i could imporve on making sure that each class is in a seperate file to ensure consistensy within the programme.
  I can do this by improving my airport challenge today, with the comments josh left on my git hub pull request.
  

Reflection on Wednesday,
----- Thursday -----

What went well,
- I found the improvements that josh left me on the airport challenge were useful and constructive, i also thought that when i
  made the improvements to the task it made sense why i had to and it made the programme overall much easier to understand.
- I also learned what a guard clause was and it turned out to be something that i was already using but i just did not know 
  the deffinition of it yet
  
What i could improve on,
- I need to improve on being able to break down a large problem into smaller steps and doing each of them steps individually,
  as i find myself thinking about other parts of the programme while doing the smaller steps and I end up overcomplicating the
  task or missing an easy solution


Reflection on Thursday,
----- Friday -----

What went well, 
- I enjoyed the workshop on inheritance and how that works accross different classes in also reducing the amount of repeated
  code accross the programme.

What i could improve on,
- I could still work on writing the programme to satisfy the tests instead of doing it the other way round.
