Reflections on last friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I figured out stage 2 and 3 of the airport challnenge quicker than stage 1 but overall the progress for the airport challenge was good

what i could improve on,
- Don't overthink the task and take a step back if i am going down a wrong path


Reflection on Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I made a good start with pair programming and made effective use of the driver, navigator strategy with my pair.
- I think this made it much easier to spot errors and make progress much more swift in moving forward.

What i could improve on,
- I need to remember that for each test it is a completely seperate block of code to he other tests. As i find myself sometimes
  not writing important lines of code in the test that may be written in another test. For example for a plane to takeoff it must
  first be at the airport or have to land then take off. its the small important parts at the beginning that i need to make sure
  i include to avoid getting errors.
