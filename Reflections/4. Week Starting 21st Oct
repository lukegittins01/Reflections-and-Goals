Reflection on last Friday,
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the friday challenge part 1 went well and i managed to do it in a quick enough time.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that i struggled alot with the 2nd part of the challenge and was being stumped by many stages of the task.
- I think that i should have made more progress in the learn-the-web challenge last week in order to benefit my progress
  in this weeks challenge
- Hopefully my progress is better this week in databases.

Refelction on Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the intoduction to databases was good in that i understood whatthe basic concepts are and what different 
  types of SQL commands there are.
- I also thought that the first day of pairing went well and me and my pair managed to get lots of progress done and 
  understood the basic concepts of setting up a database
  
What i could improve on,
- I thought that with the feedback on the learn-the-web challenge i thought that i needed to improve upon that and also get
  the second task completed that i was unable to do on Friday
  
  Reflection on Tuesday
  ----- Wednesday -----
  
  What went well,
  - I thought that the pairing went well in that we managed to make some progress and understand how an external tools can
    connect to a database made in postgres and display the data in a more understandable form.
  - I also thought that the work shop went well in that in by drawing a diagram it helped me to understand the processes
  
  What i could improve on,
  - I could have improved on the diagrams in getting a better understanding of more complex diagrams throughout the database
    model and understanding how the components work together 

Reflection on Wednesday
----- Thursday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the work shop went well in that i understand doubles much better and how i would use them. It was good to
  practice them in an excersise too, to see how they would work.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that even tho i understamd the use of doubles in still unsure as to why i would want to use one over a normal 
  varibale.
- I also thought that the progress i made yesterdays bookmark manager was a little slow due to the fact that exercise 11 is 
  quite long.
  
Reflection on Thursday
----- Friday -----

What went well,
- i thought that the paired programming went well in that i managed to get more done and feel like i had made more progress
  in the database challenge.
- I was also happy that the improvements josh left me on my learn-the-web challenge i was able to complete and learn more
  about the web design topic when doing them. I really like the improvements side of things as i feel thats when i learn
  the most in each unit.
  
What i could improve on,
- i thought that i could have improved on gettign certain tests to work with smaller parts of the porgramme as i found myself 
  sometimes having test coverage at around 94 or 95% and its all becuase i havent tested 1 varibale but it is obvious the 
  programme does what it is meant to and it works fine its just i dont have the satisfaction of 100% test coverage sometimes.
