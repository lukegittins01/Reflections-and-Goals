Reflection on last Friday,
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the friday challenge part 1 went well and i managed to do it in a quick enough time.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that i struggled alot with the 2nd part of the challenge and was being stumped by many stages of the task.
- I think that i should have made more progress in the learn-the-web challenge last week in order to benefit my progress
  in this weeks challenge
- Hopefully my progress is better this week in databases.


----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the intoduction to databases was good in that i understood whatthe basic concepts are and what different 
  types of SQL commands there are.
- I also thought that the first day of pairing went well and me and my pair managed to get lots of progress done and 
  understood the basic concepts of setting up a database
  
What i could improve on,
- I thought that with the feedback on the learn-the-web challenge i thought that i needed to improve upon that and also get
  the second task completed that i was unable to do on Friday
