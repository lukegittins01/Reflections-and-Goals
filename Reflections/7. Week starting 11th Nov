Reflection on last friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- i thought that my airport challenge in java went really well as i managed to complete 5 out of the 6 challenges for the 
  task and i was also happy about the way i was using java to complete it and how the knowledge i have learned in java has 
  helped with that challenge. i was also happy about getting the spies to work and to set default values for methods 
  specifically for testing.
  
What i could improve on,
- I thought that my reaserch into stubs led me down the wrong path and i thought this took up some valuable time in completing 
  the stormy weather task, but with some guidance with josh and a few syntax errors i was able to get it done.
