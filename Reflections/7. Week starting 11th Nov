Reflection on last friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- i thought that my airport challenge in java went really well as i managed to complete 5 out of the 6 challenges for the 
  task and i was also happy about the way i was using java to complete it and how the knowledge i have learned in java has 
  helped with that challenge. i was also happy about getting the spies to work and to set default values for methods 
  specifically for testing.
  
What i could improve on,
- I thought that my reaserch into stubs led me down the wrong path and i thought this took up some valuable time in completing 
  the stormy weather task, but with some guidance with josh and a few syntax errors i was able to get it done.

What went well,
- I thought that i understood the lanaguage java well and i thought that i made a good start and understanding in learning 
  how to test drive with java. I was happy that as a group we was able to complete fizzbuzz for java and also get an 
  understanding on simple concepts like test driving a simple addition method. i thought that i used my 'learn a new language' 
  guide well in that i followed to learn the bassic concepts before juming into even just a fizzbuzz programme.
  
What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could have improved on the tests i wrote and also the varibale names, because i found that there are more
  varibales in java i couldnt think of better names other than ones like 'thestring' or 'thenumber' and it dosent really say 
  what that is or what it is holding, so i will aimt o do that more today in the bank account challenge and also if we get 
  onto the airport challenge.

----- Wednesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the learning went really well and that as a group we managed to progress onto airport challenge and complete 
  it to the 2 user stories Linsey wanted.I also thought that as a group we went over the task more that once to understand it
  better which really helped.
  
What i could have improved on
- I thought that i could have improved on getting the methods to work propperly after a while i got them to work but i didnt
  realise that you should only generally use static once in the .main and also sometimes i dint know what to put in the 
  datatype part of declaring the method as i didnt know the syntax for it just yet but with some reaserch i got there in 
  the end.

----- Thursday -----
 What went well,
 - I thought that the java in a database went well and that as a group we made good progress  in understanding some of the syntax
 
 What i could improve on,
 - I thought that i could today understand the link between all the different files that are involved with setting up a 
  webserver and also using the database within that. i think it will help if i draw a diagram or something thayt will help
  me to understand the idea of it.
