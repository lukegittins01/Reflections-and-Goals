Reflection on Last Friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the team collaborated well and we managed to get a better working battle page down with a few more mechanics

What i could have imporved on,
- I could have improved on a few syntax errors with css sometimes i would forget a semicolon or have a space where it shouldnt
  be and also remembering some of the key terms in css would have helped as i have to google quite regularly to find some
  functions.
