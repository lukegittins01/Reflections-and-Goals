Reflection on Last Friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the team collaborated well and we managed to get a better working battle page down with a few more mechanics

What i could have imporved on,
- I could have improved on a few syntax errors with css sometimes i would forget a semicolon or have a space where it shouldnt
  be and also remembering some of the key terms in css would have helped as i have to google quite regularly to find some
  functions.

Reflection on Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that i did alot of tasks yesterday which i am happy about and that made me feel like i had contributed lots
  to the group as a whole. I am happy that the work that i did on the sunday was apreciated and a good feature in the
  game that we already have. it adds a new level of difficulty to the game, to play as different classes withdifferent 
  base stats.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could have imporved on making sure i had done everything before commiting a chnage to the repo, there
  was 2 occasions where i had to commit a further chnage to the master for the same feture just because i forgot 1 vtl
  that i didnt add css too. So i think that going over each page before commiting is a good idea to do.
