Reflection on Last Friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the team collaborated well and we managed to get a better working battle page down with a few more mechanics

What i could have imporved on,
- I could have improved on a few syntax errors with css sometimes i would forget a semicolon or have a space where it shouldnt
  be and also remembering some of the key terms in css would have helped as i have to google quite regularly to find some
  functions.

Reflection on Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that i did alot of tasks yesterday which i am happy about and that made me feel like i had contributed lots
  to the group as a whole. I am happy that the work that i did on the sunday was apreciated and a good feature in the
  game that we already have. it adds a new level of difficulty to the game, to play as different classes withdifferent 
  base stats.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could have imporved on making sure i had done everything before commiting a chnage to the repo, there
  was 2 occasions where i had to commit a further chnage to the master for the same feture just because i forgot 1 vtl
  that i didnt add css too. So i think that going over each page before commiting is a good idea to do.

Reflection on Tuesday 
----- Wednesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the amount of smaller features that i completed was good and tyhat i thought it contributed well as we now
  have a working finihsed game. All that we want to do now is deploy it to heroku so that the leaderboard results can be saved.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could have improved on remembering when to use a . and a # when refering to css attributes as it took me a
  while in some cases to realise that was the reason why they was not moving on the screen.

Reflection on Wednesday
----- Thursday -----

What went well, 
- I thought that as a group we did really well to complete the game and get it fully functioning all the cards we wanted to do
  have been completed.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could have improved on taking into consideration of multiple people playing the game at once as when we 
  deployed to heroku it would only register the once player and when someone else joins this means that they cant play
