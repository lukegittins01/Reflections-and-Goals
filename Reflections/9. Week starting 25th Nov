Reflections

Reflection of last Friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the presentation of the work that we had completed went well and that it showed what we achieved in a week.
  I also think that the finishing touches to the project went well and the css made the pages look much better.
  
What i could improve on,
- I could have improved on the layout of the css as sometimes in Intellij when you paste in items from another file it 
  indents them massively and puts lots of white space after it therefore if i was updating the layout as we was going along
  it would have looked a bit nicer rather than doing it all at the end.
  
Reflection of Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that in the end we had an idea that showed what we have learned in the course and also something that we are 
  all interested in doing.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that we should have come to a descision much quicker than what we did as it took all day to realise what it was we 
  wanted to make.

Reflection on Wednesday
----- Thursday -----

What went well,
- I thought that as a group we made lots of prpgress on both areas of the project, the shop and also the main game and also
  found a neat alternative to naimations int hat we used gifs and created some of our own gifs to put in the page.

What i could imporve on,
- I thought that i could have done more driving yesterday as i was navigating all day and sometimes driving also makes the
  code make sense instead of just watching someone else drive
  
Reflection on Thursday
----- Friday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the progress on the shop and also the battle page as a team we managed to ocmplte a lot in a small amount of
  time. I also think my individual progress towards understanding the project improved and supported my understanding when
  i started adding to the shop.

What i could improve on,
- i could have imporved on fixing certain items to the shelf so that whent the page rescales the items ont move out of the 
  shelf.
