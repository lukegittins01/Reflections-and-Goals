Reflection on last Friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- i thought that the setup of my web application and database application went well in that i thought it went smoothly with 
  very little errors on the way and if there was errors i was able to pick out where they were coming from.
- i found the test database proved useful in practicing SQL commands on it without affecting the main database.
  
What i could improve on,
- i thought that i could have improved on getting the programme to display the contents online instead of just getting it to 
  pass with the rspec test. As i found that with my first scenario it doesent acctually add them onto the webpage it just
  passes the rspec test and that is becuase i am testing it on a seperate test database.


Reflection on Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the pairing went well and that althought we only managed to complete 2 of the challenges we took our time
  to understand what exactly was being written down and that i thought was much more useful than blazing through the 
  challenges just to get them completed.
- i also throught that re doing a programme that we did before in ruby, things like FizzBuzz it was a good way to compare
  as to how exactly it differes from a lanaguage im already familiar with.
  
What i could improve on,
- i thought that i could improve on the syntax for javascript but i think that will come as i get more practice.

----- Wednesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the pairing session yesterday went well in that we got lots done and understood the task in hand well.
  I think that with that knowledge i have gained in the fizzbuzz and airport challenge i can apply that to the Thermostat
   challenge that i will be starting today.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could have improved on the syntax for Java as it is still new i do make mistakes in how things are supposed
  to be layed out and what order different components go together as i find myself sometimes writing it how i would in ruby.
