Reflection on last Friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- i thought that the setup of my web application and database application went well in that i thought it went smoothly with 
  very little errors on the way and if there was errors i was able to pick out where they were coming from.
- i found the test database proved useful in practicing SQL commands on it without affecting the main database.
  
What i could improve on,
- i thought that i could have improved on getting the programme to display the contents online instead of just getting it to 
  pass with the rspec test. As i found that with my first scenario it doesent acctually add them onto the webpage it just
  passes the rspec test and that is becuase i am testing it on a seperate test database.
