Reflection last friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- i thought that we did well to immplement the final feature to the java programme that lindsey wanted us to do and i 
  thought that the retro at the end of the day went well

What i could have improved on,
- Googling less and trying to get visibility first as i found that worked really well


----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the teamwork went well in that we managed to complete lots of tasks and also communicate between the gorup 
  what was completed and how we went about doing it.
- I also thought that progress within the backend development went well and as a smaller team we managed to complete a fair 
  sum of tasks
  
What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could have improved on understanding how the sign in feature works and whats involved within that. I thought
  that i was following along with it but i wasnt fully understanding it and the processed that were inolved with it.
