What went well,
- i thought that we did well to immplement the final feature to the java programme that lindsey wanted us to do and i 
  thought that the retro at the end of the day went well

What i could have improved on,
- Googling less and trying to get visibility first as i found that worked really well

----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the teamwork went well in that we managed to complete lots of tasks and also communicate between the gorup 
  what was completed and how we went about doing it.
- I also thought that progress within the backend development went well and as a smaller team we managed to complete a fair 
  sum of tasks
  
What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could have improved on understanding how the sign in feature works and whats involved within that. I thought
  that i was following along with it but i wasnt fully understanding it and the processed that were inolved with it.

----- Wednesday -----

What went well,
- i thought that the general progress of the grouo was good in that alot was completed.

What i could improve on,
- I could have improved on following what was acctually happening when someone was driving as in most cases the person
  driving would write something then test it the test fails and then change it again and i didnt catch what was acctually 
  going on, i think that if i asked more questions like whats happeing art certain points then iw ould have made more sense 
  of the whole project.
- Yesterday for me personally wasnt the most productive day as i was getting confused by the code that was being written.

----- Thursday -----

What went well,
- I thought that not that uch went well yesterday we got stuck in many different parts and didnt get that far.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that the approaches to different tasks could have been done a little differently and maybe when designing a
  feature to take into consideration the other team that will need a way to access the data.
