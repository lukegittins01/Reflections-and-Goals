Reflection last friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- i thought that we did well to immplement the final feature to the java programme that lindsey wanted us to do and i thought that the retro at the end of the day went well

What i could have improved on,
- Googling less and trying to get visibility first as i found that worked really well
