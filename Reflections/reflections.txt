Reflections for Day 2,

What went well,
Moving forward with the command line mystery challenge

What could improve on,
GitHub push and pull

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflections for Day 3,

What went well,
Pulling and pushing from GitHub efficiently
Working together to solve problems in the coding task - (pairing)

What was difficult,
Searching to find the right answer, sometimes it took more than one search to find what you are looking for
Some times when trying to find an answer you found yourself going round in circles trying to solve it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflections for Day 4,

What went well,
Understanding more about loops in ruby and how they work, especially while and until loops
Understanding about pushing into an array in ruby
Learned more in ruby especially looping and pushing into arrays.
Remote pairing worked well in some cases as the other person was able to spot small errors like typos when the driver was coding – this helped speed up moving forward.

What was difficult,
Again searching to find the right answer sometimes felt like I was going round in circles trying to get it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflections since day 1,
I found the GitHub work difficult and pushing and pulling from a repository was challenging for me for the first 2 days.
Syntax was a bigger issue than it is now for the ruby language on day 1
I didn’t have much knowledge on looping in ruby than I do now

What went well,
Breaking down problems into smaller parts and then putting it together at the end to make the final product
Expanding knowledge in ruby I.e. loops and used arrays more in my second version of the Blackjack game.
I'm now much more confident with pushing and pulling from GitHub to share and update code much more efficiently

What was difficult,
Getting my solution to fit the Rspec tests exactly. I had working solutions that fit the criteria but it was not in the exact way that Rspec wanted it so the tests failed.
Sometimes going round in circles to find the answer to an error that occurred and leading into further problems even though it may have been a simple fix.

What went well,
I liked it when we looked at others versions of chapter 9 wednesday challenge in the morning as i learned some thing new from seeing how someone else approached the challenge. We had both made working methods just that i thought it was useful to have another idea of approaching it.
I also throught that learning how to approach rspec went well in that i learned how to set up the baiscs

What was difficult,
Sometimes the rpec tests would not work and that was just becuase of my lack in knowledge about rspec. 
Also at times i didnt know if it was my rspec script that had a problem or my acctual code as i am still new to the way rspec is written.
