Reflection on last friday

what went well,
- i thought that i progressed well with the learnt he airport challenge in java and i managed to complete 3 of the 
  tasks associated with that
- i also through that the way josh involved us in the training day went well

what i could improve on,
- i could have improved on the syntax for java becuase i was wondering why i was getting a script error and it was 
  litterally becuase of missing 2 open and closed brackets

Reflecting on Tuesday
----- Wednesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the progress on AirBnB was really good yesterday and that as a group we managed to fix an error that 
  was preventing the ruby code form interactign with the javascript code but once it was done we then managed to complete
  a further 3 challenges which in all put us in a good position for the end of the 2nd day. I also thought that the individual 
  contribution was good as when we split off into smaller teams it was alot more efficent in getting code to work and focusing
  more on writing code than discusiing it with other members. We did discuss with the other team just at certain intervals 
  where we throught it was neccessary to when we needed our code to communicate. 
  
What i could improve on,
- I thought thatas a group when we got stuck for a very long time we should have split up and looked individually for the
  answer instead of all just statying in the same call not getting very far. Althogh after some time we made the descision
  to abandon the idea and progress further with the main goals and link our code together some other way.

Reflecting on Wednesday
----- Thursday -----

What went well,
- I thought that as a group we made the finishing touches to the programme and made it presentable in what we had mande 
  over the past 3 days. I also think that we overcame problems better in the last day if we came accross any.

What i could improve on,
- i thought that i could have improved on the syntax for SQL as i found when i was writing the SQL query for signing in i 
  was getting errors thati didnt know how to solve and we had to mix with the other front end group to resolve the problem

Reflecting on Thursday
----- Friday -----

What went well,
- i thought that our presentation as a group went well and we made it clear ehat we did and how we did it also our approach 
  to the task and how we divided up the team. i also throught that my self led study went well in that i experimented with 
  javascript and learned a bit more on how it works in hand with HTML.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could have imporved on the syntax for javascript again, as the language is still new to me i still sometimes
dont get the syntax right but with a few goofle searches i manage to fix it.
