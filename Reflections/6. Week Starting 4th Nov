Reflections

Reflection on last friday
----- Monday -----

what went well,
- i thought that i progressed well with the learnt he airport challenge in java and i managed to complete 3 of the 
  tasks associated with that
- i also through that the way josh involved us in the training day went well

what i could improve on,
- i could have improved on the syntax for java becuase i was wondering why i was getting a script error and it was 
  litterally becuase of missing 2 open and closed brackets
