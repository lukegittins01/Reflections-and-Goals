Reflections

Reflection of last Friday
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the presentation of the work that we had completed went well and that it showed what we achieved in a week.
  I also think that the finishing touches to the project went well and the css made the pages look much better.
  
What i could improve on,
- I could have improved on the layout of the css as sometimes in Intellij when you paste in items from another file it 
  indents them massively and puts lots of white space after it therefore if i was updating the layout as we was going along
  it would have looked a bit nicer rather than doing it all at the end.
