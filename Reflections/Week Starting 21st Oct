Reflection on last Friday,
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the friday challenge part 1 went well and i managed to do it in a quick enough time.

What i could improve on,
- I thought that i struggled alot with the 2nd part of the challenge and was being stumped by many stages of the task.
- I think that i should have made more progress in the learn-the-web challenge last week in order to benefit my progress
  in this weeks challenge
- Hopefully my progress is better this week in databases.
