Reflections on last friday,
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the takeaway challenege was successful in that i managed to completed the tasks and get the final one 
  complted that sent a text to your phone. 
- I also thought that i broke down the problems much better than the airport challenge and that helped me complete it 
  effectively.

What i could improve on,
- I think i could have imporved on some of the syntax still within rspec, it is getting better but there was an occassion where
  i was stuck for a while and all that needed to be put in was "classname." then the varibale so rspec syntax can be a struggle
  at times.

Reflection on Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought the introduction to the web module went well and i thought that i made a good start on the learn-the-web paring
  challenge with my pair. I also though that as i was going through the challenges i was understanding what i was learning,
  which made me feel like i was making progress.

What i could improve on,
- I could have improved on writing HTML when doing the web challenges although as it is still very new there is room for
  improvement as the week goes on.
  
Reflection on Tuesday
----- Wednesday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the workshop in the morning went well in that i understood the process of breaking down how a web application
  loads different files and what is loaded when.
- I also thought that the chome development tools helped me to understand this process well.

What i could improve on,
- I will aim to improve on the the progress within learn the web and aim to get further with the challenges in pairing.

Reflection on Wednesday,
----- Thursday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the pairing session went well and that even though my pair was on a few stages behind we still managed
  to make progress with the battle challenge and break down problems and solve them effectively.
- I also thought that the debugging workshop was useful and although i dont think that i have improved my debugging 
  skills straight after the workshop i do however feel that as the pairing challenges go on i am getting better at 
  debugging within those tasks. The ideas and approaches i use from the workshops do come in very useful in that case. So in
  summary i feel that by putting the debugging to practice is proving useful after the skills in the workshop are put in place.
  
What i could improve on,
- I thought that i could still improve on getting to grips with how all the files in a web application work together and
  i will use the learn-the-web challenge to understand it.
