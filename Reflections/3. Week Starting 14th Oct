Reflections on last friday,
----- Monday -----

What went well,
- I thought that the takeaway challenege was successful in that i managed to completed the tasks and get the final one 
  complted that sent a text to your phone. 
- I also thought that i broke down the problems much better than the airport challenge and that helped me complete it 
  effectively.

What i could improve on,
- I think i could have imporved on some of the syntax still within rspec, it is getting better but there was an occassion where
  i was stuck for a while and all that needed to be put in was "classname." then the varibale so rspec syntax can be a struggle
  at times.

Reflection on Monday
----- Tuesday -----

What went well,
- I thought the introduction to the web module went well and i thought that i made a good start on the learn-the-web paring
  challenge with my pair. I also though that as i was going through the challenges i was understanding what i was learning,
  which made me feel like i was making progress.

What i could improve on,
- I could have improved on writing HTML when doing the web challenges although as it is still very new there is room for
  improvement as the week goes on.

What i could improve on,
- I will aim to improve on the the progress within learn the web and aim to get further with the challenges in pairing.
