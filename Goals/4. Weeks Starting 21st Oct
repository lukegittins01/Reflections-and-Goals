Goals

----- Monday -----
- I want to make good progress on the intro to the databases week and this week i aim to make notes on the content as i find
  that it might help deffinately with diagrams and other useful drawings that may help me understand an unfamilliar topic.

----- Tuesday -----
- Today i aim to understand the workshop on domain moddelling for databases and how all the different systems link together
  to form one unified system. I think it will also help me to better understand how databases work, by seeign them drawn out
  in a diagram
