Goals

----- Monday -----
- Today i aim to get a good understanding of the type of project me and the rest of the team are going to undertake as i 
  want to be able to contribute fully to the tasks that are asscociated with it and i think a good understanding of it will
  help massively.

----- Tuesday -----
- Today i aim to progress within the feature that we are assigned to within the group and also understand the way in which
  we are going to do it and also another goal is to reduce the merge conflicts when we are pushing to git hub and we could
  maybe have a strategy to reduce them.
