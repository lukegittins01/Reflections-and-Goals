Goals

----- Monday ------
- Today i aim to understand the new topic that we are starting and get a good start with that.

----- Tuesday -----
- Today i aim to complete the bank account task as then i would have completed an object oriented task that involves java.
  I think that would be a realistic goal to aim towards and then as a stretch to make a start on airport challenge in java. 
  The main idea for today is to become familiar with object orientation in java.
