- Today i aim to improve on my java skills and also to make a good start on the thermostat challenge in the pairing session

  solutions and ways that i can complete what is being asked for.

- Today i aim to understand the workshop on callbacks, not sure what they are but hopefully will understand what they are
  and what they are used for. I also aim to progress further with the pairing session in the afternoon.
