Goals for today

----- Monday -----

Improve on writing tests and familiarise myself with excatly how to go about approaching them.
To understand if it is the test that is wrong or if it is the programme.


----- Tuesday -----

Study the syntax of rspec and have more success when writing the rspec code in that i don't have so many failed tests due to a misplacement of a letter in the test.


----- Wednesday -----

Improve on debugging with the debugging workshop and understand the approach to solving a programme that is broken.
