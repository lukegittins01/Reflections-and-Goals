Goals

----- Monday -----
- I aim to get start on the group work today and get a good understanding of the task in hand and distinguish between what 
  people are doing what roles and hopefully we can get a good start.

----- Tuesday -----
- I aim to progress further with the sign in feature wihtin our group project and also complete possibly 1 more task aswell
  to make good progress on todays work.

----- Wednesday -----
- I aim to progress in understanding how the date function will work as i found that i didnt quite understand what was 
  going on yesterday as i didnt drive much so it meant that i didnt fully understand the link between each part of code 
  that was being written. 

----- Thursday -----
- I aim today to progress further with the different tasks that were need to complete.

----- Friday -----
- I aim to finish off the css style sheets for each page today and make them llok the same as the posts page. I also think as
  a team we should organise a scheduek for who should say what when we show them off to the rest of the group.
