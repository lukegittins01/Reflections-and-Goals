  people are doing what roles and hopefully we can get a good start.

  to make good progress on todays work.

----- Wednesday -----
- I aim to progress in understanding how the date function will work as i found that i didnt quite understand what was 
  going on yesterday as i didnt drive much so it meant that i didnt fully understand the link between each part of code 
  that was being written.
